# New Project: Yet Another Metroidvania!
> 26 September 2022

I am working on a new project called Yet Another Metroidvania.  
As the name implies, it will be a Metroidvania, and will probably be one of my biggest projects yet.  
I am using GameMaker 2 as it is very popular for 2D games, and is also easy to pick up.  
The name is inspired by Yet Another Markup Language, and Another Metroid 2 Remake.  
You can see my progres on its Github repository at <https://github.com/TheBlueRuby/Yet-Another-Metroidvania/>
