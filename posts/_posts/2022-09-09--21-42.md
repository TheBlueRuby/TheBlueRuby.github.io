# First Post!
> 9 September 2022

This is the first (non-testing) post on this website!  
This uses Markdown for easy formatting and Showdown JS for conversion into HTML.  
Text wrapping and Dark Mode should be completed by now, and a small set of images have been added to the [images](https://theblueruby.github.io/art/) page.  
The link above should be colored bright green in dark mode and slightly darker in light mode.  
I still have to figure out how to make my markdown loader grab the file with the latest date, so I have it set to grab a latest.md file as of now.  
This should hopefully change in the future.
