# Style Changes
> 12 September 2022

You may have noticed a bunch of changes with the appearance of elements in this site.  
This is because I have been trying to move some of my CSS to Bootstrap so I don't have to write as much.  
Current changes involve:
 - Navbar is slightly rounded now
    - Navbar links are also rounded
 - Accordions are thinner now
 - Accordions are rounder now
 - Accordions have a different icon to show open state  

More art may be uploaded soon, so keep watch!
