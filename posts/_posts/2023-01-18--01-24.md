# New Year, Same Site
> 18 January 2023

Wow, it's already 2023! I know I am late to upload this (by 18 days), but I was on holiday on new year, and couldn't use my computer.  
I am trying to learn NCurses to recreate Portal's Still Alive in a terminal, but due to it not having memory safety in the C library,  
might end up scrapping the project or changing language to Rust if a binding exists.  
I have recently got Splatoon 3 on my Nintendo Switch (BlueRuby#2874) and have already somehow got 70+ hours in the game.  
For now, everything in my life is going smoothly, and I hope the 3 or so people who visit this site as well as everyone else a safe year!
