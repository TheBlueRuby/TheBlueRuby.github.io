I know this may sound dumb and unnecessary, as the 5 people who will see this probably won't be using IE9 or a 3DS, but it works on them now!  
Basically, I had to remove Bootstrap and all CSS3 from the site, and then manually edit all of the html to work properly.  
Don't worry, the main site isn't changed!  
Visit the 3DS & IE9 compatible version at <https://theblueruby.github.io/old-browsers>!
