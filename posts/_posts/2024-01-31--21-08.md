# I forgot about this site
> 31 January 2024

I've been focusing so much more on school work and YouTube that I haven't been doing any posts on this site.  
It has been over a year since the last one, and will probably just use YT Community posts instead.  
Visit my page at <https://youtube.com/@miteblueruby>, I post fairly randomly but am enjoying it.  
I will also redo some CSS for this site and the other that I've made, so my GitHub page will have a small spark of green in it.
