# Major Restructuring

> 28 September 2022

This change is probably the biggest one I have done, as it has completely changed the layout of the posts page.  
This site is now using Jekyll for Markdown on individual post pages, instead of relying on users visiting the site source.  
The raw markdown will still need to be accessed from source, but it will not need to be loaded for the end user anymore.  
So far, my local build is working, and hopefully will work after pushing.
